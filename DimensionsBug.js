This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The `Dimensions.get('window').width` and `Dimensions.get('window').height` might return `undefined` or incorrect values, particularly during app initialization or when the app's orientation changes. This happens because the dimensions might not be available immediately.

```javascript
//Incorrect usage leading to undefined values
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
console.log(width, height); // might log undefined, undefined
```
